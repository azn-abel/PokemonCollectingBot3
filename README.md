# PokeBot
A Discord bot that allows users to collect virtual Pokemon and currency.

Users may choose one of a few ways to obtain Pokemon: ```p!daily```, ```p!buy```, and ```p!redeem```.

```p!daily``` may be used once daily, granting users 1 free Pokemon and 500 PP (currency):

```p!buy``` allows users to spend 1000PP to buy one Pokemon:

```p!redeem``` allows users to claim Pokemon that are dropped into channels at random intervals.
Obtaining Pokemon this way requires quick reaction, because others are looking to redeem dropped Pokemon too. Early bird gets the worm!
